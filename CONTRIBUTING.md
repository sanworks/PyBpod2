# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to the PyBpod2 project!

# How to contribute
1. Make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the [main branch](https://github.com/sanworks/PyBpod2) of PyBpod2.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork to create a local copy of it on your machine.
3. Make any updates or additions to the code, and [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) the changes to your fork.
4. [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) your updated local fork to its remote location on Github.
5. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for us to integrate your changes into the project.

# Style Guidelines
PyBpod2 aspires to comply with [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). We recognize that neuroscience researchers are often beyond busy with research, and we do not want contributions to our tools be hindered in any way. If you are time constrained, please ensure that your contributed code works as intended, and we will make any necessary style edits on our part before the next stable release.

- Note: If you have access to OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 or equivalent, much of the heavy lifting for style compliance can be achieved with the prompt: ```Please format the following Python code to comply with pep8:```, followed by your code. The output must be validated, keeping in mind that large language models occasionally hallucinate. Also, any formatting of user-facing function names, method names or property names must be reverted or handled to preserve backwards compatibility with existing behavior protocol code.
